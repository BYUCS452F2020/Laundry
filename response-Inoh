I'm really interested in the project becuase this technology is something that we can use in our daily lives.
In my apartment complex, I use an app which uses bluetooth to connect with washer/dryer to keep track of time and other informations.
I would like to know more about what concepts and knowledges are used in this kind of application, and it would be exciting to have more
features like geographic location and preferred laundry room, etc.

It would be nice to develop back-end like you posted and perhaps we can develop this as a mobile app.
I agree that there's definitely a business opportunity here since many student housings would need this kind of app for their laundry rooms.
We might have to get approval from laundry places in order to get data and information such as tracking and connection with the machines.
I really like the idea and want to contribute to create databases and APIs, and front-end you're thinking.
