I like your idea a lot! 
I remember when I lived on campus it was a pain to know if any wash machine was available.

Business:
I think it's a great idea and it could be very useful. The place I live at now just changed they laundry machines.
Now you start it using an app on your phone and you can ealisy transer money to your account. I think your idea could really add value to any laundry business.
Legal: nothing special.
Technical:
I assume the project would be mainly backend, which is the part I like most. I also think your idea fits pretty well with the class.
