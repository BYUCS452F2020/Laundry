Laundry:  Backend for a Smart Laundry Service

Technical:
    
    Back End:
         Store information about laundry rooms (how many machines, what type, run times, etc)
         Store user information (prefered laundry room, geographic location, notification preferences)
         Track Jobs in progress and notify users
         (Possible) Track usage patterns for laundry rooms (what times are most/least busy)
     
    Eventual Front End Functionality:
        Keep track of a user's laundry: remind users when their laundry is finished, etc
        Tell users whether machines are available in their laundry room or when they should be available
 
 Planning to Implement this as a SQLite Database around Java business logic but open to other suggestions. 
 
 Business:
      There's definitely a business opportunity here but it would probably involve a hardware component as well (you'd need some kind of device to tell when washers/dryers are available). I think it would be especially successful for colleges with lots of on campus housing. 
      
 Team:
      Looking for 1-2 people who want to make this happen! I think it will be a fun project. Post something in the repo or reach out at bryanptom@gmail.com if you're interested.
