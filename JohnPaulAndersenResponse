I tell you, I really could have used something like this during my freshman year. Because I didn't have a car, doing laundry was a pretty
big time commitment and it was even bigger if the laundry machines were all in use when I got there. Having an application where I could check 
to see if there were open machines before I left and when they are usually the least busy to plan ahead would have saved me a lot of time. I
think it's an excellent idea for a project and one that should be very interesting.

Technical:
Looks like you've listed just about everything I would have done on the back-end of things. I'm curious about what kind of front-end you were thinking
about doing, because I have a lot of experience in mobile but very little in web.

Legal:
I can't see any legal issues with this app, I assume that each laundry place would need to opt-in in order to have their information tracked and listed.

Business:
I agree with the point about hardware, though some modern washing machines might be easier to connect to (I know lots of appliances have wifi connection
now). Definitely beyond the scope of this class though.
